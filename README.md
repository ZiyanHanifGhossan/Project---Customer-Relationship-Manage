# Customer Relationship Manage
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using a sales dataset. The main goal is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior to help businesses understand and target different customer groups more effectively.

**Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering**
Developed a customer segmentation project using a sales dataset to analyze purchasing behavior and identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing strategies. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and both rule-based and unsupervised learning approaches.

Key steps included loading and cleaning sales data, exploratory analysis of customer and transaction variables, and feature engineering to compute Total Price and customer Recency. Customers were segmented using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis through quartile-based classification to identify customer categories such as loyal and high-value customers.

In addition, K-Means clustering was applied to scaled RFM features to automatically group customers based on behavioral similarity. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, and cluster characteristics were analyzed using data visualization techniques. This project demonstrates the use of both traditional RFM segmentation and machine learning-based clustering to generate actionable business insights.
